Welcome to the Universe of the Star Wars trilogies
==================================

## What is our dataset?
We are looking at the APIs of characters from the Star Wars cinematic universe (Movies 1-9). We extract the dataset from [Wookepedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) and additionally, we analyze the dialogues from movies 1-6 (We haven't included dialogues from movies 7-9 because we didn't find them in good formatting).
## Why did we choose these particular datasets?
We grew up with these movies and we want to learn more about the interactions of these characters. We chose this specific dataset because we believe it would give promising results with a large network and interesting interactions. Additionally, we chose movie dialogues so we can compare how the movies and some characters (e.g. Anakin) change over time.
## What was our goal for the end user's experience?
Our goal was to extract useful information regarding the Star Wars characters and their interactions. Also, we want to demonstrate to the user a large network analysis. Finally, we want to provide a fun and interactive web interface for the user. Both Star Wars fanatics and newcomers can find interesting information on our website.
