also known inventory series insect large photoreceptors nicknamed death aboard first death model manufactured arakyd industry seen since clone later produced specially galactic empire almost always used could also armed blaster rifle created arakyd industry third class stood meter tall known posse masculine feminine programming service life unit served number function including working analyst inventory however long history service throughout galactic history considered surprising design effectively failed fulfill purpose additionally unlike unpleasant personality almost always used distinguished insectoid head resembled insectoid verpine specie head equipped broadband photoreceptors featuring antiglare coating large impressive part line result able throughout large band could work near total darkness distinct insectoid head another surprisingly advanced element came sensitive audio sensor located side head commonly overlooked element head sunburst unit magnetic sensor sensor allowed unit magnetic field shift slightly higher photoreceptors head could also filled surveillance technology making valuable criminal organization prototype holocam build therefore able shoot editing software edit footage equipped vocabulator also contained sounding though vocoders made cheap part made speech often slight mechanical buzz still able speak number language dialect able function translator language databank along comlink technology stored communication module however databank fraction size used cybot galactica language could speak shyriiwook galactic basic standard kyhhhsik could also understand binary spoken astromech example simpler joint unit built early clone shared much body plating saving factor series came cybot galactica made model unit arakyd industry created many different customized look fitting different need different client started move away using part like left later generation design included shoulder joint simpler socket joint appeared somewhat primitive unit like also pronounced vocabulator would light spoke light came color though colorization universal among model still included insectoid head large year another version unique plating unit plating equipped interface connection port simple port would unit directly connect diagnostic system fixed mainframe also equipped intersystem connection wire servomotors intermotor actuating coupling knee brain generation behind module used could never replicate understand fine nuance sentient behavior like unit could ultimately reasonably attractive moderately capable never equal unit versatility intelligence made early clone body plating created arakyd industry sold twelve thousand credit unit potentially lucrative market series long service life began introduced reign galactic republic point prior outbreak clone debut cybot galactica hold market unit hard break past never managed truly catch cybot core customer base however sell produced industrial automaton considered spectacular failure unit early finished plating often made potential customer focus difference seller market cheaper alternative part brain advanced cybot believe posed threat profit nevertheless clone republic confederacy independent system unit faction well third party like ohnaka gang intergalactic banking clan conflict proved effective strategist used republic tactical assistant aboard capital ship helping superior plan next movement finding useful analyst role administrator republic elected large number exact number thousand working everywhere republic capital coruscant military craft like destroyer unit coruscant designated used confederacy clone created separatist sympathizer arakyd industry destroyed jedi padawan ahsoka tano battle teth part ohnaka gang becoming valued part operation surveillance equipment designated served analyst republic aboard destroyer ryloth campaign though venator captain killed republic managed battle fall planetary capital lessu another astromech lower market district coruscant though unit scared believed astromech killed assassin unit stationed republic center military operation conversation astromech tano past friend arakyd industry later produced specially republic successor state galactic empire unit leftover republic older model like considered given sensitive work also considered good reduced scrap thus became inventory galactic empire aboard cargo transport assignment typical inherited republic later however defected rebellion restraining bolt removed astromech phoenix cell rebellion given sensitive work like creating fake credential undercover mission alliance restore republic engaged civil empire specially commissioning range empire made extensive despite keeping much republic stock aboard first death called death though many found derogatory term small percentage model actually worked battle station death empire specially commissioned working imperial security bureau aboard station tasked watching imperial officer make large effort keep espionage role secret shortly death destruction unit armed blaster rifle equipped utility belt stationed burnium stronghold though joined rebel colleague continued work whatever government power around imperial remnant moff gideon wrested control nevarro bounty hunter guild replacing cantina previous bartender destroyed gideon death trooper opened fire cantina another appeared gideon light cruiser rescue grogu mission taul inherited empire also used empire successor state first order despite decade passed served first order developed friendship served resistance crashing outer planet taul noted older model survived longest group choosing friendship different faction sacrificed themself leaving behind used replace missing remember fallen mission sacrifice resistance able arrange rescue admiral ackbar used conclusion killer base crisis prior destruction killer base worked part resistance network reported interrogation resistance pilot dameron aboard destroyer finalizer time mission batuu pirate hondo ohnaka wrote galactic explorer guide featured dossier ironically line never able take market share service throughout galactic history early mcquarrie pencil sketch created film episode hope costume built film taken directly elevator scene production painting pencil quick sketch ralph mcquarrie done character version seen film first appeared jawa sandcrawler reflective steinart finish quick repaint allowed costume used later death black finish torso appeared production painting would later inspire design medical head sculpted brian muir large bulbous cranium favorite design hope torso character almost exactly like mcquarrie design though done concept costume eventually shoulder epaulet installed functional joint identical likewise similar though aluminum lacked elbow piston detailing fiberglass stripped sculpted detail line give slightly different appearance costume hand simple glove plate applied give mechanical look concept unit appearance clone animated series animation geometry later updated chris glenn better match design identical barring head rebel animated series design proportion better match early mcquarrie sketch particularly rounded shoulder lego freemaker adventure peril kashyyyk lego force awakens lego terrifying tale vision duel
